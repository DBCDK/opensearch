compile with plain javac:

javac AnalysisVisualizer.java

make sure the CLASSPATH contains lucene-core.jar and lucene-snowball.jar (the snowball libs are found in the contrib of the lucene package and are built seperately).
For the sake of normal sanity, please do remember to put . on your classpath before executing. For reference, here's what my CLASSPATH looked like when executing the class-file:
CLASSPATH=/usr/local/lib/java:/usr/local/lib/java/junit4.4:/home/stm/entwicklung/dbc/OpenSearch/svn/trunk/examples/lib/lucene-core-2.3.jar:/home/stm/entwicklung/dbc/OpenSearch/svn/trunk/examples/lib/lucene-snowball-2.3.jar:.

notice the '.' at the end.

run with 
java -cp `echo $CLASSPATH` AnalysisVisualizer

I'm wholly confident that I'll look back at this a few months from now and laugh while pointing, right now I just need the reference...
