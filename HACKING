=====================
Building the software
=====================

Should be as simple as doing an::

    ant compile

If your ant distribution is not new-ish, you can build opensearch
using the packaged ant-executable::

    ./bin/ant compile

Other notable targets in the build file are::

    ant dist
    ant docs
    ant test
    ant coverage-report-html

============================
Contributing to the codebase
============================

A few conventions are observable in the process of contributing to the
codebase of opensearch, namely:

- We happily accept enhancements or patches, when they have sufficient
  coverage by test cases, as formulated in unittests and possibly
  supplied with regression tests.
- The submissions must be distributed under GPLv3 or a GPLv3 compatible
  license (see the LICENSE.txt file)
- The submissions should employ a style acceptable by the
  opensearch_checkstyle.xml checkstyle definition. This check can be
  employed using the command::
  
      ant checkstyle
