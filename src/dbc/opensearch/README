The components folder contains the components and tools used in OpenSearch.  

For a detailed description of the components and their role in the
architecture, please refer to the docs/project_information/ folder.

A brief description of the components and tools follow:

Components
* datadock: This component is responsible for communication with the
  NEP, validation of incoming data and storage in an object repository
  of said data 

* PTI (Processing-Transformation-Indexing): As the name implies, this
  component fetches data from the object repository, performs a
  transformation from the datasource format into an XML-format
  specified by the indexing engine. Finally it performs the indexing
  and storage of indexed data

* lantern: This component is responsible for conducting interpretation
  of user requests for retrieval of data based on queries. It queries
  the indexes and returns results to the NEP (through the datadock)

Tools

* processqueue: The processqueue handles the intermediate storing,
  prioritizing and state handling of the received data. It is
  implemented through a database .

* tuple: third party (javatuple.com) implementation of typesafe
  tuples. Available tuples are from 1-10 elements
