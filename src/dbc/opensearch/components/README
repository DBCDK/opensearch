The components folder contains the components used in OpenSearch.  

For a detailed description of the components and their role in the
architecture, please refer to the docs/project_information/ folder.

A brief description of the components follow:

* datadock: This component is responsible for communication with the
  NEP, validation of incoming data and storage in an object repository
  of said data 

* PTI (Processing-Transformation-Indexing): As the name implies, this
  component fetches data from the object repository, performs a
  transformation from the datasource format into an XML-format
  specified by the indexing engine. Finally it performs the indexing
  and storage of indexed data

* lantern: This component is responsible for conducting interpretation
  of user requests for retrieval of data based on queries. It queries
  the indexes and returns results to the NEP (through the datadock)

* processqueue: The processqueue handles the intermediate storing,
  prioritizing and state handling of the received data. It is
  implemented through a database .
