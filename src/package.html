    <body>
  
  The Opensearch project has 3 different main responsibilities: 
  - Receiving, identifying and storing data, indexing data and
     finally facilitating access to data through direct reference or
     as a result of queries.
  
   - Recieving, identifying and storing data
     This is the responsibility of the DataDock component.  The first
     task of this component is to receive data, identify it and
     validate the attached metadata for later processing.
 
     After validation, the recieved data is stored in an internal
     format (a CargoContainer) with identification markers.  Second,
     the component must store the data in the fedora repository, alert
     the pti component of the new task, and lastly return an estimate
     of the time before the data object is effectively searchable.
     \see DataDock  
  - Indexing data.
 
    This is done in the PTI component. 
    When alerted of a new data object to index, this component retrieves a copy 
    of the data from the repository and prepares it for indexing. Through the
    Compass framework the data gets indexed and saved in the database. When this process is finished, the 
    estimate table in the database gets updated.
    \see PTI  
 
  - Facilitate access to stored data
 
    To be implemented in 0.8
 
  \section Components
 
  \subsection DataDock
  The DataDock consists of a plugin system, that takes care of the following tasks:
  - Receive data.
    This part is somewhat hardcoded and currently only supports
    reading files from disk (through the FileHarvester).  Data is
    read from files in a directory given in the DataDock
    configuration. The information needed for indexing - which is
    mimetype, language, submitter and format - is also given qua the
    path of the files. These arguments are validated, and a
    CargoObject with the data and meta data is constructed for each
    data subject in the source.
  \see DataDockPoolAdmMain, DataDockPoolAdm, DataDockPool, CargoContainer 
  - Store data in repository.

    When a CargoContainer is constructed the DataDockPool spawns a DataDock thread.
    The DataDock thread stores the data in the repository through the Fedora API classes.
    \see DataDockPool, DataDock, FedoraAdministration, FedoraTools

  - Alert the PTI Component of a new data object

    After the data is stored, a repository pointer is pushed onto the Processqueue,
    which will be polled by the PTI component.
    \see DataDock, Processqueue

  - Return an Estimate of the time before the data object is searchable.\n

    Reads an average process time for data with this mimetype from the statisticDB 
    table in the database, and returns a suitable estimate for how long time remains 
    before the data object is searchable by the Lantern component to the submitter.
    Currently the estimate is printed to the log
    \see DataDock, Estimate
 
  \subsection pti PTI (Processing, Transformation, BLABLA)

  The PTI Component is - like the DataDock - a plugin system. It runs
  as a daemon service that polls the Processqueue for new repository
  pointers. The service handles the following tasks:

  - Polling Processqueue and start processing/indexing.

    The PTIPoolAdm class polls the Processqueue, and when a new data entry is made 
    by the DataDock, it starts a new PTI thread through the PTIPool.
    \see PTIPoolAdmMain, PTIPoolAdm, PTIPool, Processqueue

  - Process and transform data for indexing.
    This only works for faktalink xml at the moment. The Indexing is done with a 
    Compass instance, And the indexes in the faktalink instance re generated by using
    Compass XSEM mapping feature. Later other format can be index using XSEM or  the 
    mapping models provided by Compass. 

    \see PTIPool, PTI, Compass

  - Indexing and Storing of data.
    The Indexing and storing of the indexes is done through a CompassSession. It stores 
    the indexes in an oracle database.

    \see PTI, Compass

  - Update Estimate for this mimetype.
    After the indexes are stored in the database the data object is searchable. The 
    PTI thread exits, and return the actual processtime for this data object. The average 
    process-time is calculated and the StatisticDB table in the database is updated with 
    the new information. 

    \see PTI, Estimate
 
  \subsection Lantern

  Functionality of this module is not yet implemented, a prototype of the funtionality is available through Solr.
 
  \section Common
  Here follows a description of the tools used to facilitate the components.
 
  \subsection FedoraCommunication

  - Storing and retrieving data.

    When used to store data, the FedoraCommunication simply iterates
    the CargoObjects of the CargoContainer and constructs a Fedora
    DigitalObject that - roughly - corresponds to the
    CargoContainer. The idea being that the CargoContainer can be
    replicated in the exact same state from the DigitalObject.

  \see FedoraCommunication
 
  \subsection Processqueue

  The Processqueue is used to register not yet indexed data
  objects. The class handles all communication to the Processqueue
  table in a DBMS. When the DataDock has stored the data in the
  repository, a pointer to the data is pushed to the queue. This
  enables the PTI component to poll the Processqueue and, when a new
  data-element is present, to pop it from the queue. After the PTI
  has ended indexing the pop will committed to the queue, thereby
  ensuring atomicity of the transactions made throughout the system.
  If something goes wrong in the indexing process, a rollback of the
  pop is possible. \see Processqueue
 
  \subsection Estimate
  The Estimate class handles all communication with the StatisticDB
  table in the database, and is used to return an estimate of the
  time before the data is searchable.  It provides methods for
  retrieving and updating estimates for the processing time of
  mimetypes.  \see Estimate
  
  \section Executables
  
  \subsection DataDock

    starts The DataDock.

    example of usage:
