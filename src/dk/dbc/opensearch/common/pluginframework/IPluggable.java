/**
 * This interface represents the base point for all plugins. It
 * defines two methods that are the common basis for all plugins that
 * perform tasks in the datadock or pti.
 * 
 * The pluginID must be given to the plugin at object creation
 * time. The taskname is defined at compile time but could be the
 * subject of configuration variables in the future.
 * 
 * \todo: make the taskname a configuration value instead of setting it compile time
 * 
 * Plugins in the opensearch plugin framework are expected to work
 * primarily with CargoContainers. Plugins are defined on the basis of
 * the format they're going to work with combined with th e type of
 * task they're going to perform. E.g. for the format 'faktalink' (DBC
 * material, formatted in XML), the tasks could likely be:
 * 
 * 1) harvest: reading one or more files from a path and putting the
 *    content of the files and known metadata about them into
 *    CargoContainers.
 *    
 * 2) annotate: lookup metadata relating to the data in a
 *    CargoContainer and annotate the metadata to the
 *    CargoContainer(s).
 *    
 * 3) index: convert the CargoContainer into a lucene index
 * 
 * 4) store: format the CargoContainer into a Fedora Digital Object
 *    and store the digital object in the Fedora Digital Repository.
 *
