/**
 * This class enables locking based on identifiers. Currently the
 * identifiers need to be {@link String}s.  There are no limitations
 * on the contents of the {@link String}, just that it is not null.
 * <p/>
 * The class contains two public methods {@link StringLock#lock(
 * String )} and {@link StringLock#unlock( String )}. It is therefore
 * evidient that the identifier is needed both for locking and
 * unlocking. This enables a thread to lock on more than one identifier at a time
 * <p/>
 * The internal lock is based on a reentrant lock type, and as such a
 * thread can lock the same identifier severeal times without
 * unlocking it. Please notice, that the thread must perform as many
 * unlocks as it performs locks in order to truly release the lock for
 * use by another thread. 
 * Please see {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock} for reference.
 * <p/>
 * Internally the identifiers are connected each to a different
 * lock. A lock will only be kept internally as long as it is in use.
