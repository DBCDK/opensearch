/**
 * Pair is, as the name suggest, a very simple version of a IPair container.
 * You can add two objects to Pair and retrieve them again.
 * The objects may be different, identical, or the actual same object.
 * After you have added the objects to Pair you can no longer modify them,
 * i.e. Pair is immutable, even though the objects inside Pair may be mutable (see below).
 * <p>
 * Please notice, Pair do not use defensive copying of its two elements.
 * As a consequence if you modify the original objects after adding them to the Pair,
 * the objects inside Pair will also be changed. It is the responibility of the user of Pair
 * to ensure the correct behavior of the objects after adding them to Pair. This is of course only
 * possible if you use mutable objects.
 * <p>
 * If you would like to have sorting done on a IPair type, please use
 * {@link ComparablePair} instead
