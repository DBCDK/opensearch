/**
 * SimplePair is, as the name suggest, a very simple version of a Pair container.
 * You can add two (different) objects to SimplePair and retrieve them again.
 * After you have added the objects to SimplePair you can no longer modify them,
 * i.e. SimplePair is immutable, even though the objects inside SimplePair may be mutable (see below).
 * <p>
 * Please notice, SimplePair do not use defensive copying of its two elements. 
 * As a consequence if you modify the original objects after adding them to the SimplePair,
 * the objects inside SimplePair will also be changed. It is the responibility of the user of SimplePair
 * to ensure the correct behavior of the objects after adding them to SimplePair. This is of course only 
 * possible if you use mutable objects.
 * <p>
 * If you would like to have sorting done on a Pair type, please use
 * {@link ComparablePair} instead
