/**
 * Super (or base) class for the config classes. Hence: 
 * 	 
 *       DO NOT ALTER THIS CLASS IF IT CAN BE AVOIDED!!!
 *    
 * It should read one config file and make this file accessible via a 
 * constructor -- and do nothing else! That is, the sole purpose of this 
 * class is to provide access to the configuration file:
 *                   
 *                   ../config/config.xml. 
 *                    
 * This file is parsed and made available to sub classes through a non 
 * static object.
 * 
 * The intended use is for sub classes to provide access to configuration 
 * settings via static methods. This is done via:
 * 
 *     1) a private non static method, and 
 *     2) a public static method using a sub class object. Throws a 
 *        ConfigurationException.
 * 
 * Sub classes shall implement a constructor to handle the exception 
 * thrown in case the config file cannot be read (ConfigurationException).
