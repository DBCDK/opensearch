/**
 * This class enables locking based on identifiers. Currently the
 * identifiers need to be {@link String}s.  There are no limitations
 * on the contents of the {@link String}, just that it is not null.
 * <p/>
 * The class contains two public methods {@link StringLock#lock(
 * String )} and {@link StringLock#unlock( String )}. It is therefore
 * evident that the identifier is needed both for locking and
 * unlocking. This enables a thread to lock on more than one
 * identifier at a time
 * <p/>
 * The internal lock is based on a reentrant lock type, and as such a
 * thread can lock the same identifier severeal times without
 * unlocking it. Please notice, that the thread must perform as many
 * unlocks as it performs locks in order to truly release the lock for
 * use by another thread. It is the responisibilty of the thread to
 * ensure that as many unlocks as locks are performed.
 * Please see {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock} for reference.
 * <p/>
 * Internally the identifiers are connected each to a different
 * lock. A lock will only be kept internally as long as it is in use.

      We need to maintain a relationship between a Reentrant lock and
      a String (the identifier) on which the lock is associated.  This
      relationship have decided to maintain in a map (HashMap), with
      the String as Key and the ReentrantLock as Value, thereby
      ensuring that at most one ReentrantLock can exist for a given
      String.

      We also strive to meet the goal of not keeping unused locks in
      the map.  We do this by maintaining a counter, which tracks how
      many threads have called lock() on the ReentrantLock
      
      Internally in this class, we therefore need to maintain a
      relation between the String, the ReentrantLock and the counter.
      We have decided, instead of having the ReentrantLock as the
      Value of the HashMap we use a Pair-type as Value, which contains
      a ReentrantLock and an Integer.  Notice, that we cannot use the
      primitive 'int' in a Generic, and therefore we need to use the
      boxed primitive Integer. An Integer-type is Immutable, and
      therefore, each time we need to increment or decrement the
      Integer, we must associate a new Pair-object with the String in
      the HashMap. This choice do clutter the following code a little,
      but we think it better to use a well tested type (Pair) over creating
      an internal class which in order needs to be well tested in
      order to ensure correctness of the overall algorithm.
