This test is made to test the interaction between the database and the
program which can't be tested by unittesting.

To use the program two things are required:

1: Database with an empty table, procedure and sequence.
   The database schema can be found here: 
   OpenSearch/trunk/admin/processqueue_init.sql
   
2: The database properties in the config.xml file must be set.
   The file is located at OpenSearch/trunk/config/config.xml
   
   here is an example configuration: 
   
   ...
   <database>
     <driver>oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver</driver>
     <url>jdbc:oracle:thin:$USER/$USER@tora1.dbc.dk:1521</url>
     <userID>$USER</userID>
     <passwd>$USER</passwd>
   </database>
