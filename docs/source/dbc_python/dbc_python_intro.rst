Introduction to the DBC Python Project
======================================

In the Opensearch project we use scripts from the DBC Python Project in specific scripts 
used mainly in build, patch, and deployment processes. For a thorough description of the
DBC Python Project please visit this page: http://hudson.dbc.dk/view/Openseach/job/dbc-python-head-metode/Project_Documentation.

Reusable scripts from the DBC Python Project is included in the Opensearch scripts by use
of ``svn externals``. How this is done is also explained in the above mentioned documentation.
