snaptools contains tools to copy an index from a master index
(compass)to a slave index, and notify the slave solr instance in a
safe way. for more information on specific script run ./snap[name] -h.
      
      files:
        snapshooter.py
                This script is used to make a snapshot in the master index 
        snappuller.py
                This script is used to pull a snapshot from master to slave
        snapinstaller.py
                This script install a snapshot on the slave and makes the
                slave solr aware of the newly installed index
        snap.conf
                This file contains configuration parameters. all snapscripts 
                read arguments from this file if not present on commandline
        snapcleaner.py
                Removes snapshots from an index folder
        snappuller-enable.py
                enables snappulling by slave
        snappuller-disable.py
                enables snappulling by slave

Example:
        1. set config parameters snap.conf for easier execution.
        2. make sure snappulling is enabled:
                   %> ./snappuller-enable.py
                   snappuller enabled
                   %>

        3. make snapshot:
                   %> ./snapshooter.py
                   taking snapshot  
                   %>
           now a snapshot is made and placed in the master index folder.
        
        4. pull snapshot:
                   %> ./snappuller.py -v
                   pulling snapshot
                   %>           
           The snapshot is rsynced over to slave index folder.
        
        5. install snapshot:
                   %> ./snapinstaller.py
                   committed to http://localhost:8983/solr
                   %>
           The snapshot is moved to the slave index folder, and the 
           slave solr is notified.
